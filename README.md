PROJECT ON CALCULATOR ,APPLICATION USING METHOD OVERLOADING
ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project is a simple Java program that demonstrates method overloading through a calculator application.
It performs basic operations like addition and multiplication with different parameter types and counts.

ðŸ’¡ Concept

Method Overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists (number or type of arguments).
It represents compile-time polymorphism in Java
